Hashing:
Hashing is also a common method of accessing data records. Consider, for example, a list of names:
John Smith
Sarah Jones
Roger Adams
To create an index, called a hash table,for these records, you would apply a formula to each name to produce a 
unique numeric value. So you might get something like:
1345873 John smith
3097905 Sarah Jones
4060964 Roger Adams
Then to search for the record containing Sarah Jones,you just need to reapply the formula, which directly yields the 
index key to the record. This is much more efficient than searching through all the records till the matching record is found.

Hash Function:
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes. 

Hash Table:
In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
